<h2>Music and my life</h2>
    
<p>Unlike video games, music was never really big in my life until high school. I had drummed and played guitar 
in my childhood, but I never really listened to new music all that regularly. I was a massive fan of Fall Out
Boy and Paramore, and I was content with that.

This changed probably my sophomore year of high school, when I created my first band with my friends.

We created a jazz combo called _Six O'Clock Swing_</p>
    

<p>I'll get more to that later, but for now I'll stay on topic. 

After this band, I discovered my love for Jazz and funk music. From this point on, I made listening to new music
a habit. I would listen to new albums weekly, and these days my music taste has completely transformed!</p>
    
<h3>Some of my favorite bands/ artists include:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>The Growlers</li>
  <li>The Frights</li>
  <li>Summer Salt</li>
  <li>Shannon and the Clams</li>
</ol>
    
<h3> Six O'Clock Swing </h3>
    
<p>As stated previously, I was in a band throughout high school. This slowly branched out into other projects, like
_The Robidoux's_, but none were as big as Six O'Clock Swing. 

We managed to play almost every venue in town, and when we weren't able to, we hosted garage concerts. I have so 
many fond memories of gigging with my band mates, even once opening for Jukebox Saturday Night!

We were the front cover of the newspaper several times, and also made an effort to perform with as many local
musicians as we could! 

You can watch a (very very old and rusty) video of us performing [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1H1iI4eiXG8)


The love for making music had sprout, and I slowly expanded my musicianship to bass guitar, with which I played in
my school's jazz band for 3 years. I now keep it as a hobby.</p>
