<h2>Music and my life</h2>
    
<p>Unlike video games, music was never really big in my life until high school. I had drummed and played guitar 
in my childhood, but I never really listened to new music all that regularly. I was a massive fan of Fall Out
Boy and Paramore, and I was content with that.

This changed probably my sophomore year of high school, when I created my first band with my friends.

We created a jazz combo called _Six O'Clock Swing_</p>
