<h2> Video Games and my Childhood</h2>
    
<p>For as long as I can remember, video games have always been a huge part of my life. Growing
up, I would play on my brother's hand me down gameboy color. I would play Tetris, Pokemon Blue,
Ninja Turtles, and so much more. I got an Xbox 360 when I was 12, and I've fallen more in love
since.</p>
    
    
<p>Obviously now, as an adult, I don't have as much time for video games. However, this doesn't
mean I don't still FIND time to indulge. WHen I do, I strictly game on my PC. At the moment, most
of my game time is spent in Overwatch, Hearthstone, or most recently, Diablo II Resurrected (I
like Blizzard if you can't tell :)).</p>
   
<h3> Some of my favorite games include:</h3>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Starcraft II</li>
