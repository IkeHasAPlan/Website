    <h1>Movies and my life</h1>
    
<p>Over quarantine 2020, movies quickly became one of my newfound loves. I swear there would
be weeks where I would average a movie a day, and I thoroughly loved it. I watched so many
movies, that I had it made up in my mind that I could maybe one day become a director. I 
mean, when you've seen as many movies as I have, who could possibly be a better director?
(sarcasm haha)</p>
    
<p>But seriously, after a long and stressful week, there's usually nothing I want more than simply sitting down and enjoying a new movie.</p>
    
<h3>Some of my favorite movies are:</h3>
    
<ul>
  <li>There Will be Blood</li>
  <li>Scott Pilgrim vs. The World</li>
  <li>Django Unchained</li>
  <li>The Founder</li>
</ul>
    
<h3> My experience with videography </h3>
    
<p>During my senior year of high shool, I had the privilege of taking part in the production of
my school's video announcements! It's silly, I know, but I got some great experience in as a
filmer and editor! I got familiar with Premiere Pro, filming, and how it feels to collaborate
on something as big as dropping a new episode every week. </p>
    
<p>Then at the end of the year, my Creative Literature teacher announced that our final project
would include us making our very own movies. 
I was thrilled to put my skills to use. I knew that if I never touched a camera again, I would
want this to be my "Magnum Opus" if you will.</p>

<p>So with that, I got some buddies together and made a cheesy high school flick about a camping 
trip gone horribly wrong... </p>
    
<p>Appropriately titled <i>The Trip</i>, you can watch it here.</p>
