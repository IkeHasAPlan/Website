      What is Drum Corps?
    </h2>
    
    <p> Drum Corps is an activity popular amongst band kids that is essentially professional marching band. In order to participate, a performer must audition at one of many corps hosted by Drum Corps International(DCI). If a contract to participate is awarded to said performer, they must then sacrifice their entire summer (the usual season for DCI) to attend spring training and tour. World class tours can run through the entirety of July, and end between August 8-10th, at DCI World Championships in Indianapolis. You can participate in Drum Corps until you "age out" at 21. </p>
    
    <p> To newcomers, this whole concept must seem strange. Why sacrifice a whole summer for band? Why pay so much money to compete? How competitive are these groups?

      To clarify, here is a video of Carolina Crown's 2018 show Beast.
      
      There are two competitive pools that Corps can compete in. These include World Class and Open Class. Here are some corps from both divisions!</p>
