<h2> What is Drum Corps?</h2>
    
<p> <b>Drum Corps?</b> is an activity popular amongst band kids that is essentially professional marching band. In order to participate, a performer must audition at one of many corps hosted by Drum Corps International(DCI). If a contract to participate is awarded to said performer, they must then sacrifice their entire summer (the usual season for DCI) to attend spring training and tour. World class tours can run through the entirety of July, and end between August 8-10th, at DCI World Championships in Indianapolis. You can participate in Drum Corps until you "age out" at 21. </p>

<p> To newcomers, this whole concept must seem strange. Why sacrifice a whole summer for band? Why pay so much money to compete? How competitive are these groups?</p>

<p>To clarify, here is a video of Carolina Crown's 2018 show Beast.</p>
      
<h3> My experience with Drum Corps</h3>
    
<p>I marched Drum Corps with the Colt Cadets in 2019. Our show was titled "Of a Feather" and was about birds. I have since gone on to participate in indoor drumline, and now university band. I am auditioning again this year, and hope to spend my summer with the Troopers Drum and Bugle Corps!</p>
